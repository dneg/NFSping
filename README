NFSping is a command line utility for measuring the response time of an NFS server. It's basically a copy of the fping interface but doesn't share any code with that project.

On modern NFS servers, the network stack and filesystem are often being run on separate cores or even hardware components. This means in practise that a fast ICMP ping response isn't indicative of how quickly the NFS filesystem is responding. This tool more directly tests the NFS component of the operating system.

It checks if the server is responding by sending an NFS NULL procedure and checking for a response. The NULL procedure is a noop that is designed for testing. NFSping supports versions 2 and 3 of NFS. By default it doesn't use the RPC portmapper and defaults to checking port 2049 using the UDP transport.

It can also check the NFS mount protocol response.

In its most basic form it simply reports whether the server is responding:

$ nfsping localhost
localhost is alive

and exits with a return status of 0, or:

$ nfsping localhost
clnt_call: RPC: Timed out
localhost is dead

and exiting with a status of 1. This simple form of the command can be built into scripts which just check if the server is up or not without being concerned about a particular response time.

To measure response time, pass the number of requests to send as an argument:

$ nfsping -c 5 localhost
localhost : [0], 0.09 ms (0.09 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [1], 0.16 ms (0.12 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [2], 0.15 ms (0.13 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [3], 0.16 ms (0.14 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [4], 0.12 ms (0.14 avg, 0% loss)

localhost : xmt/rcv/%loss = 5/5/0%, min/avg/max = 0.09/0.14/0.16

To exit early, use control-C.

It also has a form that produces more easily parsed output:

$ nfsping -C 5 localhost
localhost : [0], 1.96 ms (1.96 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [1], 0.11 ms (1.04 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [2], 0.12 ms (0.73 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [3], 0.16 ms (0.59 avg, 0% loss)
localhost : [4], 0.18 ms (0.51 avg, 0% loss)

localhost : 1.96 0.11 0.12 0.16 0.18

To only show the summary line, use the -q option.

To keep sending requests indefinitely like traditional ping, use the -l option.

This is a list of the available command-line options:

Usage: nfsping [options] [targets...]
    -2    use NFS version 2
    -A    show IP addresses
    -c n  count of pings to send to target
    -C n  same as -c, output parseable format
    -d    reverse DNS lookups for targets
    -i n  interval between targets (in ms, default 25)
    -l    loop forever
    -m    use multiple target IP addresses if found
    -M    use the portmapper (default no)
    -n    check the mount protocol (default NFS)
    -p n  pause between pings to target (in ms, default 1000)
    -P n  specify port (default 2049)
    -q    quiet, only print summary
    -t n  timeout (in ms, default 2500)
    -T    use TCP (default UDP)

NFSping will handle multiple targets and iterate through them on each round. If there are multiple DNS responses for a target, only the first is used. All of them can be checked by using the -m option. The sleep interval between targets can be controlled with the -i option. If any of the targets fail to respond, the command will exit with a status code of 1.
